# Introduction
The following is a comparison of classical literature and modern fanfiction based on structural elements of each, like word usage and sentence structure.  We drew both types of literature from internet sources, specifically [Gutenberg Archive](https://www.gutenberg.org/) for classics and [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) for fanfiction.  

To test our methods, we use a random sample of 10 classics and 10 fanfictions, and then performs several types of analysis on each.  Although we used a small sample for this test, our method is scalable for much larger inputs.

This document will walk you through the process of how we acquired our data, what we did with it, and what we found.
